</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>As a seasoned software engineer at Fortune 500 companies, I have contributed to more than 30 professional
</p>
<p> projects as a team member and have developed more than 20 utility tools as an individual. I spend most of my
</p>
<p> time developing frameworks\platforms, client-server applications and auxiliary tools. I am thoughtful, insofar
</p>
<p> as trying to use the best algorithms and design patterns, as well as pragmatic to ship the product on time.  I
</p>
<p> label myself as a curious engineer who can make quick hacks using libraries or spend hours to prove a greedy
</p>
<p> algorithm. I participate in competitive programming through codeforces and TopCoder. I also maintain my
</p>
<p> academic bonds through open MOOC platforms such as Coursera and Udacity.
